**To test our prototype, follow these steps in order:**

1. Enter the gymrats directory

`cd gymrats`

2. Start the backend

`cd backend`

`python3 server.py`

3. Start the frontend

- Open a new terminal instance

- Go back to the gymrats directory `cd ..`

- Enter the frontend directory: `cd frontend`

- Run the frontend: `npm start`

- If there are issues with packages not being installed or files not being found, ensure that all of the packages are installed using: `npm install`

4. View the prototype

* The backend should automatically be running on `localhost:5000` and the frontend should start running on `localhost:3000`. If the frontend does not automatically start, go to your browser (Chrome or Firefox) and go to `http://localhost:3000/`.

* In your browser's quick settings, go to the 3 lines or dots in the top right corner. Click on More Tools and then Developer Tools. Ensure the dimensions are set to any iPhone, but preferably iPhone 12 Pro or iPhone 14. Make sure the zoom setting is set to "Fit to Window."
